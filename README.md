# Bribing The Red
A game made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 5 in a week.
(Or more as I didn't get to submit it in time)

The Jam had a theme of "Your Country's History", so the game is about exploiting the reqard system the British had during the Malayan Emergency in Singapore/ Malaya from 1948-1960.
